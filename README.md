# Vehicle-alarm-system-based-on-drowsiness

Driver drowsiness is the main cause of accidents in the world as well as in India. Due to lack of sleep and tiredness, drowsiness can occur while driving. The best way to avoid such circumstances and accidents caused by drowsiness is to detect drowsiness of the driver and warn him before he/she falls into sleep.  
In this project, we propose a method of detecting driver drowsiness by the method of face/object detection. We have designed a system that comprises of detection of eye movements in real time. Further, the changes would be done according to the experimental results obtained.
